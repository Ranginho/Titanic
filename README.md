# Titanic

This is well-known problem for kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic
Here I have notebook for this problem where I did some data analytics and then I wrote logistic regression model without any libraries, I wrote sigmoid function, cost function and prediction function and I got nearly 80% accuracy.
